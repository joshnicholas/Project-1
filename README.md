# Project-1
This is a simple number guessing game created in Python 3. The user will be prompted to enter a number between 1 & 10, and their input will be compared against a pseudorandom number. Users will be prompted to enter values only between 1 & 10, and will be continuously prompted until they guess the correct number. Users can continue to play for as long as they would like, and high scores will be tracked across multiple games. 

## Prerequisites
 Python 3.x

## Getting Started
Start this game by typing the following command in the terminal/command prompt:
	python ./guessing_game.py
